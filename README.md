## Inspiration

With elections right around the corner, many young adults are voting for the first time, and may not be equipped with knowledge of the law and current domestic events. We believe that this is a major problem with our nation, and we seek to use open source government data to provide day to day citizens with access to knowledge on legislative activities and current affairs in our nation.

Our platform aims to bridge this knowledge gap by providing easy access to legislative information. By leveraging open-source government data, we empower citizens to make informed decisions about the issues that matter most to them. This approach not only enhances civic engagement but also promotes a more educated and participatory democracy.

## What it does

OpenLegislation allows users to input an issue they are interested in, and then uses cosine analysis to fetch the most relevant bills currently in Congress related to that issue.
